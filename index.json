OCI 101은 101개 영상으로 구성되며, 순서대로 시청하시면 오라클 클라우드에 대한 기본 개념과 사용법을 파악할 수 있도록 구성했습니다.\nOCI 101 클래스 구성 OCI 101을 구성하는 각 문서는 1개 이상의 유튜브 영상과 영상 요약 정보 및 실습 코드로 구성됩니다. OCI 영상과 해당 문서를 이용하여 OCI 기초 실습을 쉽게 따라 하실 수 지원하는 것을 목표로합니다.\nOCI 101은 101개의 강좌로 구성됩니다. 각 문서는 8~15분 길이의 영상을 포함합니다. 영상은 내용 소개와 데모를 중심으로 구성됩니다. 영상속 데모는 시간 조절을 위하여 실제 수행 시간보다 빠르게 편집될 수 있습니다. 실행 시간을 고속으로 편집할 경우 주석으로 영상에 표시하겠습니다.\nOCI 101 실습 환경 OCI 101에서 다루는 대부분 강좌는 OCI 무료 계정인 OCI Free Trial과 Always Free에서 실습할 수 있습니다. OCI 무료 계정에서 실습이 어려운 경우 영상과 개별 페이지에 별도 테그로 표시하겠습니다.\nOCI 101 문서에 오류나 부정확한 내용을 발견하시면, 여기에 Issue 등록으로 연락해 주십시오. 여러분의 피드백은 문서를 개선하는데 큰 힘이됩니다.\n "
